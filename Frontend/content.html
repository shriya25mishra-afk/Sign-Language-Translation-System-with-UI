        The <strong>Real-Time Sign Language Translator</strong> is an innovative system designed to bridge
        the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and non-signers. Using advanced 
        <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> techniques, the translator 
        detects and recognizes hand gestures captured via a webcam or smartphone camera, and converts them 
        instantly into text or speech output.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The system employs a deep learning model trained on various sign language datasets. It processes
        the input video frames, extracts hand landmarks, and identifies gestures using a neural network.
        The recognized gestures are then translated into meaningful words or phrases, making it possible 
        for real-time communication.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This project contributes to <strong>accessibility and inclusivity</strong> by helping people with 
        hearing and speech disabilities communicate effortlessly in real-world scenarios like education,
        healthcare, and public services.
